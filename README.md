## Introduction

In the world of modern web development, integrating data from external sources is a common requirement. When building React applications, Axios stands out as a versatile and easy-to-use library for making HTTP requests to fetch data from APIs. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of fetching data from an API and displaying it in a React component using Axios.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Node.js**: If you're working with React, you probably already have Node.js installed. If not, download and install it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **React**: Ensure that you have a React application set up. If not, you can create one using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

3. **Axios**: Axios must be included in your project. You can install it via npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install axios
   # or
   yarn add axios
